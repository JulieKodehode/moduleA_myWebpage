          Working on HTML and CSS have been the best summer activity this year, getting a
          introduction to coding in
          <a href="https://scrimba.com">Srimba</a> have been filled with a lot of the feeling
          <strong>achivement</strong>, but also <em>frustration</em>. And I think that it bringing
          out both a positive and negative feeling, means that the dedication and motivation gets
          even stronger to get more of the positive happy feeling. Starting the
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/introhtmlcss">HTML and CSS crash course</a>
          was interesting, entertaining and so rewarding when I finished the little projects they
          have between the modules. Going from the simple Hello World to making a website in two
          months. And even better is the journey going to be now at
          <strong style="font-size: 18px">Kodehode</strong>.

        <h2>Welcome back anytime,</h2>
        <p>
          After getting a <small>small</small> understanding in HTML and CSS I started the
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript">JavaScript</a> and to say I wanted to
          throw the pc out the window every few seconds is not an overstatement. But I finished
          three projects and have the tiniest bit of understanding, but I'm so
          <strong>exited</strong> to actually learn how to use JS without needing to cheat the
          answer to understand what is happening. <br />
          One thing that I found more interesting then I tought it would be was Figma. Learning
          design was both harder and easier then I tought it would be. Harder because there are so
          many different options, but easier because once I made one it would turn to two - and
          three and suddenly I had made four different options on the same idea because there were
          always something else I could add to make it just <em>a little bit better</em>.

          Im aspiring to become a frontend-developer, and I feel like I already have all the parts
          to my rocketship. Now I just need to assemble the parts and learn how to control the ship
          so this journey doesnt become a Icarus retelling, but goes all the way into the galaxy of
          oppurtunities. Learning frontend proves to be as easy as to get lost in as a few hours of
          playing video games or reading a book. And turning hobbies into a paying job is
          <strong>gold</strong>.
